Geographic & Vehicle Space Segmentation
In this part, we analyze the EV market across various states and then select the states to target and also the kind of EV to make.

Targetted States: Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka, Gujarat, Delhi Targetted Vehicle Space: Cycle, Car, Moped, E- Rickshaw
