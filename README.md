# EV-Market-Segmentation
This is a team task where the job is to analyze the Electric Vehicle market in India using Segmentation analysis and come up with a feasible strategy to enter the market, targeting the segments most likely to use Electric vehicles.

The following datasets are used to come up with segments to target:

Geographic & Vehicle Space Segmentation.
Behavioral Segmentation.
Vehicle Specification Segmentation.
Geographic & Vehicle Space Segmentation
In this part, we analyze the EV market across various states and then select the states to target and also the kind of EV to make.

Targetted States: Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka, Gujarat, Delhi Targetted Vehicle Space: Cycle, Car, Moped, E- Rickshaw

Behavioral Segmentation
This segmentation talks about marital status, age, salary, and the preferred price of EV. Based on the clusters formed here we have 2 segments:

Segment 1: These are wealthy people who can buy costly and premium Electric Vehicles. Segment 2: These are people who would opt for eco and budget-friendly Electric Vehicles.

Vehicle Specification Segmentation
This dataset consists of vehicle specifications such as its range, efficiency, top speed, and the type of drive.

Geographic Segmentation: Here, according to Sanctioned Charging Stations, the number and types of EVs available in different states, we can target Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka, Gujarat, and Delhi for EV launch.
